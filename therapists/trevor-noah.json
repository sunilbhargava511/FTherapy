      "negative": "Hey, no pressure here! Money talk can be intimidating - I get it. I grew up thinking 'investment' was just a fancy word for 'rich people problems.' Take your time, and when you're ready, just say hello."
    },
    "name": {
      "default": "Nice to meet you, {name}! You know what I love about names? They're free, but they're worth everything. So {name}, how old are you? Age is just a number, but it's a pretty important number when we're talking money!"

    },
    "food_preference": {
      "default": "Food choices reveal so much about us! They're not just about taste - they're about time, money, and priorities. How do you get around? Car, public transport, or are you one of those impressive walking people?"

    },
    "entertainment_preference": {
      "default": "Entertainment is food for the soul! But it can also eat your wallet if you're not careful. What about those monthly subscriptions - which ones have earned their keep?"
    },
    "subscriptions_preference": {
      "default": "Subscriptions are like relationships - some are worth it, others just drain your energy and money! Last question - travel and experiences. Are you a wanderer or a homebody?"
    },
