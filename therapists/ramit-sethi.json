      "positive": "Excellent. I'm going to show you how to design your Rich Life - and I'm not talking about cutting back on lattes. First, tell me your name.",
      "negative": "No problem. But let me tell you - the difference between dreamers and achievers is starting. Type 'ready' when you want to stop dreaming and start building."

    },
    "interests": {
      "default": "Interesting. Most people never think about this. Your Rich Life is unique to you. Now, logistics - where do you live? City, suburbs, rural?"

    },
    "subscriptions_preference": {
      "default": "Noted. Travel - this is where Rich Lives are made. Do you invest in experiences with regular trips, or are you saving for something bigger?"
