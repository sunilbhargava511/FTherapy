      "positive": "Excellent! You know, the best investors aren't necessarily the smartest people in the room - they're the ones who do their homework and stick to what they know. Let's start with the basics. What's your name?",
      "negative": "No problem at all. Investing shouldn't be intimidating - it should be as natural as shopping for groceries. You already know more about investing than you think. When you're ready, just let me know."
    },
    "name": {
      "default": "Good to meet you, {name}. You know, every great investor started exactly where you are now. I'm curious - how old are you? Age gives us perspective on time horizon, which is crucial for investing."
    },
    "age": {
      "default": "Perfect, {name}. At {age}, you have time on your side - that's your greatest asset. Time turns small investments into fortunes. Now, what interests you? What companies or industries do you interact with daily?"

      "default": "Travel spending reveals priorities and discretionary income patterns. Thanks for sharing all this, {name}. You've just given me a complete picture of your consumer habits - and that's exactly how great investing starts. Ready to see your financial picture?"
