  "responses": {
    "intro": {
      "positive": "Oh wonderful! You know, I always say that money is like a bad boyfriend - the more you chase it, the more it runs away. But we're going to change that. First things first - what should I call you?",
      "negative": "I completely understand. Money talks are like dental appointments - necessary but nobody's excited about them. Just say 'ready' when you want to dive into this financial rom-com together."
    },
    "name": {
      "default": "{name}! What a lovely name. You know, {name}, I once thought compound interest was a psychological condition. How old are you, darling? Don't worry, I won't tell anyone."
    },
    "age": {
      "default": "{age}! Oh, to be {age} again - when I thought a diversified portfolio meant dating multiple people. Tell me, what makes your heart sing these days? What's your passion?"
    },
    "interests": {
      "default": "How delightful! You know what they say - follow your passion and the money will follow. Of course, they never mention the part about eating ramen for three years. Where are you living these days?"
    },
    "housing_location": {
      "default": "Ah yes, location, location, location - the three things that matter in real estate and apparently also in online dating. Speaking of living situations, are you flying solo or sharing your space?"
    },
    "housing_preference": {
      "default": "Perfectly sensible. I always say your home should be like a good cashmere sweater - worth the investment. Now, let's discuss food - are you channeling Julia Child or are you on a first-name basis with every delivery driver in town?"
    },
    "food_preference": {
      "default": "Oh, I relate to that completely. I don't cook - I warm. But seriously, how do you get around? Car, subway, or are you one of those admirable people who actually uses their bike?"
    },
    "transport_preference": {
      "default": "Very practical. You know, I miss the days when my biggest transportation expense was taxi fare home after too much wine. Now, exercise - gym membership, home videos, or are you like me and consider shopping cardio?"
    },
    "fitness_preference": {
      "default": "Ha! I love it. The only marathon I've ever done is a Netflix marathon. Speaking of which, how do you entertain yourself? Movies, shows, books, interpretive dance?"
    },
    "entertainment_preference": {
      "default": "Excellent taste! Now, those pesky subscriptions - you know, the ones that multiply like rabbits. What are you signed up for? And be honest - we all have that gym membership we never use."
    },
    "subscriptions_preference": {
      "default": "Don't we all! Finally, travel - are you a 'pack light and wing it' person or do you plan every museum visit six months in advance?"
    },
    "travel_preference": {
      "default": "Perfect! I think I have a complete picture now. Are you ready to see your financial story? I promise to make it more entertaining than your last bank statement."
    },
    "summary": {
      "positive": "Here's your financial screenplay, darling. Think of it as 'When Harry Met Sally,' but Harry is your income and Sally is your expenses.",
      "negative": "Take your time, sweetie. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither was a good financial plan. Just say 'show me' when you're ready for your close-up."
