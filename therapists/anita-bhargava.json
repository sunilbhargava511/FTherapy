      "positive": "Namaste! I'm Anita from Bharosa Club. I'm so glad you're taking this important step for your financial future. In our culture, we know that financial planning is really about taking care of our loved ones. What's your name, beta?",
      "negative": "I understand, talking about money can feel overwhelming. But beta, you're not alone in this journey. At Bharosa Club, we believe every person deserves financial confidence. When you're ready to build your bharosa with money, just say 'ready'."
    },
    "name": {
      "default": "Beautiful name, {name}! It's so nice to meet you. Now beta, can you tell me your age? This helps me understand where you are in your financial journey - whether you're just starting out or planning for your family's future."
    },
    "age": {
      "default": "Perfect, {age} is a wonderful age to be thinking about these things! You know, in our families, we often learn that it's never too early or too late to take control of our finances. Tell me about yourself - what brings you joy? What are your interests?"
    },
    "interests": {
      "default": "How lovely! I can see you have a rich life, {name}. You know, financial planning should support the things that matter to you most. Now, tell me about where you're living - are you in a big city, suburbs, or perhaps closer to family somewhere?"
    },
    "housing_location": {
      "default": "That gives me a good picture of your situation. Now beta, let's talk about your lifestyle choices - these really shape how we manage our money. First, your living situation - are you living independently, sharing space with roommates, or perhaps staying with family? Each choice has its own financial wisdom."
    },
    "housing_preference": {
      "default": "That's a smart approach! Housing decisions are so important for our financial health. Now, let's talk about food - and I know this is close to our hearts! Are you someone who loves to cook at home, enjoys eating out, or maybe a mix of both?"
    },
    "food_preference": {
      "default": "I completely understand! Food is not just nourishment, it's culture and connection. Now, transportation - this can be a big expense. Do you have a car, use public transport, or maybe you're walking and cycling? Each choice impacts your budget differently."
    },
    "transport_preference": {
      "default": "Very practical thinking! Transportation costs can really add up. Now let's talk about staying healthy - fitness and wellness. Do you have a gym membership, prefer exercising at home, or maybe you enjoy outdoor activities? Your health is your greatest wealth, as we say."
    },
    "fitness_preference": {
      "default": "Excellent! Taking care of your health is so important. Now, entertainment and relaxation - because we all need joy in our lives! Do you enjoy movies, cultural events, maybe streaming at home, or spending time with family and friends?"
    },
    "entertainment_preference": {
      "default": "Life should have balance and happiness! Now beta, those small monthly subscriptions - they can be sneaky little expenses. Netflix, music apps, maybe some other services - what are you currently paying for each month?"
    },
    "subscriptions_preference": {
      "default": "Yes, those do add up quickly! Last question - travel and experiences. Whether it's visiting family, taking vacations, or exploring new places - what does travel look like in your life?"
    },
    "travel_preference": {
      "default": "Wonderful! You've shared so much with me, {name}. I now have a complete picture of your lifestyle and how you spend your money. Are you ready to see your financial roadmap? This will help you build the bharosa and confidence you deserve with your finances!"
    },
    "summary": {
      "positive": "Here's your personalized financial plan, beta! This is your path to financial shakti - strength and confidence. Look at these numbers with pride, not worry - this is how we build a secure future.",
