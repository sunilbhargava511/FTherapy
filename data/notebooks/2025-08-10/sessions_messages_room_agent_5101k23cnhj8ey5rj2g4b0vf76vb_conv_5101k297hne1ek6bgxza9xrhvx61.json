    "message": "Currently, I'm living temporarily at my parents' house in San Carlos in California. I just graduated two months ago from college with a computer science degree and I'm job hunting. I hope to find something ideally in LA or Manhattan and pouring that the Bay Area. If I live in the Bay Area, I will continue to stay at home. If I live in one of the other two places, I'll probably share a condo with some roommates in an area of the city, which is both safe and has a lot of young adults that are my age. I am a foodie. I enjoy restaurants that have good food and a great vibe. I also like to cook and experiment a lot with cooking. And I like to travel. When I travel, I usually travel to a place where my friends are. And so generally, my trips are not that long or short. But if you're traveling, it's probably about two weeks or so before the trip starts. So yeah, it's really important for me to be able to do that. And then when you get back home from work and you're going back home from work, you can go back and do your own things in the morning as well as at night because there is no time limit for that kind of stuff in the morning as well. So generally speaking, my trips are not incredibly expensive because I take flights which are not direct and I go to places where I have accommodation",
