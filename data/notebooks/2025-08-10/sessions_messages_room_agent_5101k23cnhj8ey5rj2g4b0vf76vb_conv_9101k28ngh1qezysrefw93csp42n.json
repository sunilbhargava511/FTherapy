    "message": "I am living with my parents at home in the San Francisco Bay Area. I just graduated from college two months ago and I'm looking for a job. I will...I'm looking in New York and Los Angeles as well as the Bay Area. Currently in my free time, I've been doing a little bit of travel because before I get a job and get busy, I thought I'd get some things out of the way. These are not expensive trips. I take cheap connecting flights and stay at friends' places. Outside that, I work out every day. I'm a member of the local gym, which my parents belong to, the community college gym, and then I like cooking and eating. And then when I get home from work, outside probably three meals, three dinners, I eat only at home. What else can I tell you? Please let me know.",
